<p>I have developed several solutions using Python and AWS Lambda.  This webpage is 
  hosted at <a href="https://w3.petergrecian.co.uk">w3.petergrecian.co.uk</a> using Lambda and with code 
  available on github at <a href="https://github.com/PeterGrecian/cv">github.com/PeterGrecian/cv</a>.
<br>
Using Python, Lambda, DynamoDB and API Gateway I wrote the production microservice which provides unique identifiers 
for every published article.
  I also wrote a lambda to stop EC2 and RDS instances in dev and stage at night and weekends, 
  and a simple web interface for developers to startup sets of instances outside these hours and 
  another to increase the size of EC2 instances for a few hours in anticipation of high load. 
  <br>
  I used python to calculate the required Reserved Instance renewals each year, to predict annual costs and to 
  suggest actions to reduce costs and carbon emissions.
</p>
<p>Working in the fields of AI research and film and TV CGI I have proposed, built 
  and operated CPU/GPU clusters, including networking, air cooling, power distribution 
  and software installation.  These cutting edge fields require the ability to exploit 
  the latest hardware to provide novel applications using bulk computing, 
  high speed networks and clustered storage.</p>
<p>Modern compute is orchestrated with Kubernetes and I have configured loads using Kustomize, 
  Github Actions and ArgoCD.</p>
<p><strong>2018 - 2024 The BMJ.  AWS Cloud Engineer/DevOps.</strong>
The British Medical Journal is one of the most prestigious publications in its field.  
The BMJ publishes 60 journals in paper and digital form and a clinical decision 
support tool called "Best Practice" which is the product I have been most 
closely associated with.</p>
<p>Initially the app was unreliable and would alert the operator on call most 
  nights, via Pager Duty.  Sometimes that would be me.  I installed an ELK 
  stack, and traced the issue to a combination of EC2 instances having insufficient 
  memory, Xmx being set incorrectly for the Java processes and in one case a 
  Java library which had a memory leak.</p>
<p>Having achieved stability I could then right size the EC2 instances and 
  move to ARM architecture to save money and carbon emissions.  Subsequently, compute 
  loads were migrated to Kubernetes using EKS/ECS.
<p>Provisioning is with terraform, EC2 configuration with puppet.  I've written 
  applications for the developers to start up dev and stage stacks "on demand", 
  and to stop instances at weekends etc using lambda, python, flask and dynamoDB.</p>
<p>I am expert at OpenSearch Dashboards and have presented talks on how to troubleshoot issues using 
  this powerful tool.  I maintained fluentbit/logstash ingestion into the 
  OpenSearch domain I named "The Logstore".  I often helped developers with queries and searches.</p>
<p>AWS cost estimation and planning is one of my specialties.
  I have presented talks to my colleagues on this topic and been drafted in to projects for advice.</p>
<p>I also use prometheus, Jenkins, AppDynamics, grafana.  Cloudwatch alerts.</p>
<p><strong>Jan 2015 - Mar 2018: Crystal Ski (TUI holidays).  Senior Cloud Engineer/DevOps</strong><br>
Responsible for providing AWS hosting of a website which sold 100s of millions 
of pounds of skiing holidays each season.  Puppet, terraform, Jenkins.</p>
<p><strong>Feb 2014 - Jan 2015:  Method Studios.  Senior Systems Engineer</strong> for a 
  Hollywood special effects company.  High speed bulk data handling using Isilon 
  storage, DST tape and 10GE switches.</p>
<p><strong>June 2012 - Feb 2014: Google DeepMind. Senior Linux Systems Administrator</strong> for a 
  rapidly expanding startup company purchased whilst I was there by Google.  Design, purchase and installation of a high power Linux compute cluster with Grid Engine job scheduling for neural network training.  I was expert on the HP/Supermicro Intel product lines and how to get the most compute power in the smallest space.  Working with researchers of international renown.</p>
<p><strong>Jan 2008 - June 2012 Freelance hardware engineer and systems administrator.</strong><br>
Designing building and selling an all in one storage and network solution for 
mid size boutique visual effects companies in and around Soho, using 10GigE and RAID controllers.</p>
<p><strong>Aug 1994-Jan 2008,  Senior Systems and programming lead, Moving Picture Company</strong>.  
  Providing bespoke hardware and C++ and Python software solutions for TV advertising and 
  broadcast and film clients.  Developed real time hardware rendered particle 
  systems for National Lottery commercials and Harry Potter Films.  Working with film directors and advertising agencies.</p>
<p>Prior to working in TV and film I worked at Philips Research on Gallium 
  Arsenide transistors for 6 years, publishing papers in journals and presenting 
  a paper at a symposium.</p>
